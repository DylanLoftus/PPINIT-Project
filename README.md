## Overview
We decided to use Unity as we had used it as part of the Graphics Programming module in semester 5. We both really enjoyed using it so this project gave us the opportunity to use it more and learn more from it.

## Brief Description
* The game is a 2D platformer.
* The game is largely focused on co-operation.
* As a result this game cannot be played by a single player and must be played with 2 players.
* The aim of each level is to collect all of the keys.
* 2 players - Eugene (Yellow) and Hubert (Red).
* Eugene can only traverse on Yellow Platforms.
* Hubert can only traverse on Red Platforms.

## Key features
* Each level 1-6 has a progressive difficulty increase.
* 2 player.
* Multiple spawn points.
* A pleasent, user friendly UI.
* Sound effects and music.
* Camera locks onto both players.
* Health and Key Collection implementation.
* Level Selector shows if you have completed a level.
